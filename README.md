# SimpleEQ

From MatKatMusic's free tutorial. To create this, I followed along without copying as much as possible. 

This tutorial is solely to learn basic plug-in anatomy and functionality of different components. There are many things to do different in a production product. For instance:
- Fix Code organization. Separate out classes to different files. 
- Create and destroy filter coefficients on a different thread other than the audio thread.
